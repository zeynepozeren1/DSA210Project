"My undergrad was not in Computer Science, it was in Biology. However, I had a significant focus on bioinformatics (coursework, 2 summer internships, and a senior thesis) and I'd gotten a minor in CS / taken most of the basic core CS courses (Data Structures, Algorithms, etc.) as part of it. I had to do a one-way video interview which I felt like I botched but made it through and a brief technical assessment (randomized questions on a variety of topics; not too difficult if you've had any exposure to CS) because I didn't major in CS."

Kind of happy for the admit. I am skill sceptical about how good the program is. Can any one tell me how good are the courses and how are PMP students differentiated from regular MS students. 2. Job opportunities ? This program is specifically made for Industry oriented students; how well do students get placed here ?

"Rejected from PhD, accepted to MS program. No funding, but recommended for TAship. Don't know how I got in at all with such a crap GPA...rejected from other lower-ranked CS programs. 3 good lor, good sop, research experience; 1 2nd author applied ml research article in mediocre journal, several unpublished and ""in submission"" projects, had interview with a prof. Just got lucky I guess - I think I was considered a wildcard admit. Some more transcript info: C + and an F in 5 honors math courses, C in advanced algorithms, As in 3 graduate machine learning courses and TA for machine learning/AI courses for 4 semesters. Other admits include WashU (PhD CS), U Wisconsin (MS in Bioinformatics), Stony Brook (MS CS), University of Rochester (MS CS). Rejects include NYU, UC Berkeley (lol), U Washington (lol), UC SB, TTIC, University of Chicago. I will choose this program."

"I also have and admit from CMU MCDS. Really confused between the two primarily because though CMU has a huge brand name and a good course structure for MCDS, I've head it gets quite hectic since I'll be taking 4 courses per semester in order to complete the requirements in 16 months. There is a 20 month option as well but I don't think its worth the extra $40k. Apart from being a well renowned university for MS CS, I really like the course structure at Georgia Tech too give that the program spans 2 years, I can engage in research work as well. I'd be grateful if anyone of you could give your inputs which will help me in making a proper decision! Thank you :)"

"Warning: From my personal experience, Ron Fedkiw at Stanford CS is a toxic advisor and a textbook narcissist, very self-centered and obsessed with control. None of his current students has even one paper published with him during their 3-10 years of time in his lab. Some of them have graduated with only arXiv papers. He has now quit Stanford due to a conflict with the department."

"From a German university, but not a highly ranked one like TUM or KIT (QS around 450). TOEFL 106. Two letters of recommendation—one might be strong, but I’m not sure what ""strong"" means in this context. Research experience includes a research internship at MPI, one year as a TA, and one year working at a research institution. Started working in a lab this fall. My Statement of Purpose might have been good, but I have no real benchmark for comparison. Honestly, I didn’t expect to get in, especially after reading the rejections here. My grades are generally strong, but my transcript isn’t perfect—there’s a small note, more of a detail, that I thought might get me rejected. My worst grades (2.0 and 1.7) are in math-related subjects, so I was worried that might hurt my chances. Still a bit surprised, but I’m excited for the opportunity and will do my best!

"This is for an MS in CS (for S&E). BA in Statistics from a Top 5 US public school, with all A's in CS courses like ds&a, OS, DB, AI, etc. No published research but a strong undergrad honors thesis in statistical machine learning, and a few decent projects in deep learning and computer vision. About 2 years of experience in startups and Big 4 consulting. Program-tailored SoP, though written in one night so not perfect. 1 LoR from a manager. The program targets engineering or science majors, but seems open to others with relevant experience or coursework in computing."

"First off, I want to formally thank my close freinds, advisors, and mentors for believing. I want to especially thank my mom. She worked double shifts just to keep a roof over my sisters and I ever the past few years. Second, I'd like to say FUCK YOU to all the people who said I wasn't â€œsmart enoughâ€ or said my goals were too high for my expectations. Your skepticism and negative treatment only fueled my determination. Third, I'd like to say a special huge GO FUCK YOURSELF to one of my high school teachers and to one of my EECS Professors at Berkeley. Both of you doubted my abilities and underestimated my abilities as a student, particularly highlighting both of my physical and health challenges as a barrier to my success in the engineering field. You thought that being in a wheelchair would prevent me from achieving milestones in my life. You would have never thought a guy in a wheelchair could BOTH get a job at Google w/ a 6-fig salary AND get into Stanford Graduate Engineering school in the same month.

People look up to those who attended prestigious institutes , but little do they know that there are several more who are capable of attending them but are not able afford them. A handful take huge loans with hopes that some company will hire them with enough salary to help payback that loan. What abt those who arent willling to take on a huge loan and rely on the university's tag? their skills are pretty much the same regardless of whether or not they attend the institution.

"I just want to say, don't listen to the admission office. He's there to discourage you. I called the CS admission office asking about the paper works and he said ""our admission process is very selective, your chance of getting in is very low"" He kept saying that 3-4 times, even though I didn't ask him about my chance. I have a low GRE score, but my grade is very high (almost the top 5% of my class) and my work experience is related to their research. The professor that wrote me a letter of rec has some close contact with ETH professors too. Maybe that helped me get in. I'm from the US btw."

I'm applying straight from undergrad at Berkeley with an unconventional interdisciplinary CS-focused background. I thought that that would be a turn-off but I guess they liked it? I also got a TAship that covers tuition plus a $12,900/quarter salary. I had 4 significant research experiences throughout undergrad, 2 were in CS but not super technical and all were CS-adjacent. I had 1 first-author paper at an ACM conference which won Best Paper, and I had another one in preparation at the time of the application (currently have 4 in prep, 1 under review).

"I was feeling so low after multiple rejects until I was not. It was 3 AM, and I was soaked in motor oil when I got a call. It was Mr. Massachusetts Institute of Technology himself. ""I have seen you use computers, and you sure as hell know how to handle those bad boys. The way you slap them keyboards and mouse makes my CPU run hot. Let us computer science together here at MIT, I really want to see you science these computers"". I was elated, until I realized. ""But Mr. MIT, I would never science a computer other than mine, I have a religious upbringing. I hereby will have to decline your offer"". He responded ""Ok""."

"Hey I am Prathamesh and currently I'm pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Fall 22) It has been a little over a year since I began the application process, and as I remember it to be, it was constantly one task after another. Being an international student there were a lot of variables at play and tackling all of them can become intimidating. To provide more clarity, I've attempted to write a rather detailed, end-to-end article around the whole process. It's something I was looking for last year, for myself, but couldn't find. Hope it adds some value for those of you who plan on going for Masters in the near future. Article: https://medium.com/@prathameshsonawane/how-what-when-a-guide-to-ms-923b456c0560"

"TTPB: Yes I heard the same things from my seniors. Tbh, whenever you ask a senior who has recently joined the university, he'll always have positives to talk about. People say they left gatech and columbia for usc. It's better to ask working professionals who graduated from USC and are working for like 1 year or so. You ask any working professional, 95% of them have the same opinion, that as long as the university is decent enough, nothing matters more than your calibre. My brother graduated from Rutgers and is currently working in California based company and his coworkers are from USC who are getting equally paid. He was able to waive off his debt in like 10 months, whereas his coworkers are still in debt."

"I contacted one of my seniors who went to USC in Spring 19 to know his view points. Posting it here so that many can benefit: 1) Major drawback is the internship opportunities. According to him, many students had really hard time finding internships. Now people say that you get 3 semesters to prepare for internships. So, then what about jobs? You waste 3 semesters in preparing and finding internships. Then there's only 1 semester to search for jobs and conversion of internships to jobs is really less. 2) Acc to him, wasting 6 months in India and then wasting 3-4 months in summer break is of no use. Yes, you can part time jobs in the break but is part time jobs > Your precious time in life and finding internships? 3) Many good professors at most universities including USC won't be available for Spring term as they are busy with research work. So for core courses, he had to take classes of some professors which weren't that great. 4) He graduated in December last year and is working at some Cali based startup that pays around 80-85k. Acc to him, his co-workers are from UT Dallas, UCSD, UIC, Penn state, NEU and NCSU. All these people are having the same pay. 5) His last view point was that career fairs at USC were total shit. They have some lottery based system to pick colors and you can only attend companies that fall under those colors. So, he advised me to go ahead with the other admit and not to obsess over USC."

I received a notification on 11th May that my USC ID was created, and today (13th May) that I have received an offer and need to submit financial docs. Funny situation. They took 4 months to start reviewing and 2 days to review. Anyways, everyone who's still waiting please contact the office to ensure that your application has been reviewed at least. Good luck!"

"As a parent of a boy who has got admission into PennState, who wont be taking it since he has got Purdue and Wisc Mad PMP and will be most likely taking the former and will be considering OSU (another seat) along with PennState as trophies, I thought it right to comment about the situation this year as I have been following this site steadily for the past few months. My son has high end CGPA+rank from a top State college in India (forget this stupid Tier 1 etc that many Indian students rant about...I personally am an IIT B.Tech, IISc M.E. of yesteryears (1980s) and wont rant about it unnecessarily!) has 6 publications as on date (journal + conference...decent International ones...not the top most ones!) and I must say without doubt has been lucky to get what he got. I am aware of others with almost similar CGPA not getting any top 20 college, even some who are again seniors and rankers of my son from his college. I am also aware of some with lower CGPA and zero experience who have got top 20 from his college. While I admit, that I am illiterate in talking about SOP etc (as I never tried to go for higher studies in US in my times!), I can say that the idea that SOP defines the possibility sounds ridiculous. In fact one stupid comment I get from my son's contacts and even on net is that ""dont mention financial help in SOP"". To be precise my son mentioned it in almost all cases. There are comments about ""dont underline or use bold"" and I as the person who was helping review my son's SOP and even the LORs (which of course were accepted by his recommenders!) had BOLD, UNDERLINE and ITALICS. What I want to tell as a senior person about this GRAD program looking students are the following. 1. Getting a Univ in US (did not try other places) based on my son's and the others that I could track shows that IT IS JUST A LOTTERY. So many who are frustrated that what you perceive as you being better and not getting a college while somebody bad got it, just shows that you did not win the lottery. 2. While I said 1 above, certainly a CGPA of 9+ helps though I think 9.5+ seems to have a bit of negative effect especially in the top 30 colleges sometimes. They probably rejected you because they thought you were not going to join or you were not the right fit. 3. Coming to the above point, RIGHT FIT is what the Prof who took your Application thought about it. So if the right Prof got your appln. and he wanted you, may be you got it. In simple there is a high level of randomness and so dont curse yourself for failure. Bad luck. 4. Finally this year is THE REAL BAD YEAR. Penn State that my son got and will not be taking seems to have hardly taken more than few Indians. Strange but true. Many with decent profile didn't get it. I am not even talking of WiscMad rejecting hordes for the MS Traditional program. Overall, it looks like that Covid year is a big game where the Colleges were trying to find the right match and they had invariably hangover of previous year students who had deferred it. 5. The scene might only improve marginally next year as per my guess. Since the carry flow of the deferrals and the space lost last year (by folks not joining) will get into the next academic year, I dont think situation will be same even in 2021-2022 as it was in 2019-2020 and before. So the trouble you saw this academic year might actually continue for one more year if flow control exists. Anyway colleges have their ways of dealing with it. 6. Finally, I find there are 2 types of US colleges. Ones that you pay and get a seat easily potentially with say 9+ and nothing more (Columbia, UPenn, USC and even quite a few branches of CMU and well WiscMad PMP!) and others where you need to slug it out. If my career in the SWindustry of the past means anything, nobody in US in a job really cares so much about college etc (the Tier based approach so sadly seen in Indian colleges!) once they are placed in a job. So if you joined NCSU and I joined Cornell, it is not really that in the end you are low class and I am high class. Please try to understand that. Something I tend to educate my son as well. The truth is you are worth what you are and the colleges took you for what they felt you were. Good luck."

Torn between G.Tech MSCS and UCSD MSCS. Have got good and bad reviews on both. Slightly inclined towards UCSD because of more flexibility to choose courses and better CV research. People I reached out to said in rankings both colleges are identical. Agree to the general norms that both colleges have taken in good profiles as well as profiles below average in the name of diversity. Overall cost of the MS is also nearly identical at both places but UCSD seems to have the nicer weather while TA is completely waived off in GTech. Any responses would be highly appreciated

"After my 2 long comments yesterday with admits in OSU and then Purdue, got the third one for PMP at WiscMad. Not bad given that not even a handful got WiscMad MS CS (with aid option) and PMP is an excellent substitute for the same. Not sure how to choose between Purdue and PMP WM, though might end up on the former. UNC with hardly any seats gave the cold shoulder. Not bad for me with 11 applications to have 3 admits, 6 rejects and 2 waiting. One Penn likely to get, other UCSD GOK. The way UCSD which is the standard place even the low ranks from my college get, year after year, has neither rejected me nor accepted me, is rather funny. Was in the bottom of the LIFO stack having tried in Oct 20. Will wait but UCSD does not excite me any longer even a bit and Penn will add to the OSU like trophies which I wont carry. So very happy with Purdue and WM but not sure how to chose. All my admits have happened in past 9 days and I have waited since Oct 15 2020 for the same. WORTH THE WAIT. All the best to the others."

"Got my second admission and one that I can take. As I stated just below (in OSU admission) the same Lacey Siefers of Purdue who said I have not got admission writes stating ""I am excited to inform you that the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University is recommending you for admission to the MS program beginning fall 2021. You will receive your admission message from the Graduate School through the electronic application system in a few days. "" So for those who ask these schools whether they have been rejected, they simply state that you are not in accepted pool, so must be reject, but later like me can get the admit as the many applications including yours might be in processing. SO UNTIL YOU GET A REJECT ONE SHOULD WAIT. Also in my case, much against my dad's advice I chose to apply well in advance and so Purdue was my first application on Oct 15 followed by OSU in a few more days. I get Purdue almost a month after the first round. My third application in end Oct was UCSD and I am assuming I might again get it. EVERYTHING seems to be LIFO and not FIFO unless ofcourse like OSU all admits are sent out in a group. Along with the Purdue good news, I got a reject from GA. That means top 10 colleges (4 applied) all reject. Maybe my experience (just passed out in 2020 Aug) was not sufficient though I seem to have scalped something out by decent CGPA and a few Intl. Publications. Happy that I will hopefully fly out as Purdue is fine and I am more or less going to take it though I might wait for UCSD and for WiscMad PMP. Anyone has suggestions among these three can please respond. Two more awaited are UNC and PennState. All the best to other applicants."

"Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing well! I have been accepted to the CS MS programs at Columbia, UCLA, and UT Austin, and I'm having trouble finding any extremely concrete advantages/disadvantages that some of these schools have in relation to each other so that I can have tangible reasons for filtering some of the schools out and coming to a decision. I was wondering if anyone might have any insights, from personal experiences or from friends, about any of these schools that you would be willing to share. Columbia and UT Austin have coursework only options (without research), whereas at UCLA you're required to do a thesis/project, and since I am not planning on getting a PHD and I don't enjoy research very much, coursework only options appeal to me more. Cost is definitely one factor (Columbia comes out to be around $57,000 more expensive than UT Austin, and about $45,000 more than UCLA), but I don't want to base my decision solely, or extremely heavily on cost, as Columbia has some advantages the other schools do not (located in NYC, near Wall Street, as I am potentially interested in going into the fintech/financial industry after getting my Master's degree). Thanks so very much! :)"

We are pleased to inform you that you are being recommended for admission to the Department of Computer Science - Master of Science (MS) program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign beginning with the Fall 2021 term. With successful completion of the MS program, you can apply to continue on for the PhD program. We believe that our graduate program can provide an excellent environment for your graduate studies. At this time, we are unable to guarantee any funding assistance. There may be a possibility to secure a teaching or research assistantship pending availability for this upcoming academic year. There are other units on campus that may be offering assistantships if you are looking for one. Below is the link that may be of assistance in locating an assistantship or hourly employment prior to arriving to campus. Application for financial assistance always exceeds our departmental resources making it impossible to offer aid to all qualified applicants. Assistantship Clearinghouse (www.grad.illinois.edu/clearinghouse) If this recommendation for admission is approved by the Graduate College at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, you will receive an offer of admission from the Graduate College.

"Australian university without honours (3 year degree). 93.6 average mark, from what I know basically top 3 in course (~600 people). 167/169/4.5. 2 summer research in Med Phys, resulting in first author in to-be-published paper in top journal, another half a year doing compsci reserach (around 1.5yrs in total). Good SoP (did my research on the uni), decent LoR (1 from deputy dean of compsci, 1 from my reserach supervisor). Participated and won a few hackathons, top 5 in regional finals for ICPC, and some high impact awards at international level in high school. I thought lack of honors would disadvantage me, but clearly not. The long wait between results was killing me, thought I was a goner for sure. This is my top choice, since lack of honors means I cannot apply for US unis nor PhDs, and this is the best masters program out of all others."

"An international student at a west Canadian university. Applied MMath thesis option, and interviewed by the POI twice. The first is the behaviour interview, which lasts for an hour (basically the POI talked for 45 mins and I talked for 15 mins...). The second is a technical interview; I present the papers that I co-authored, and the POI asked a bunch of problems, which last for three hours... and was told (and emailed) by the POI that he will accept me. The official offer will take one week to be available. I will accept the offer since the POI and UWaterloo are my top choice! Also admitted by a Ph.D. program in the states, but I am worried about the strict and unclear immigration policy, so I would rather not risk it, thus will decline."

"TTPB: I was accepted to the Connective Media program and I also had a hard time choosing between the two. The biggest difference is the length as you mentioned. The MEng program is 9 months with no option to extend. This means you'll be looking for a full time role as soon as you start with no internship opportunities. The CM program is 2 years and obviously has an internship opportunity which is a HUGE pro as you can imagine. Further, the CM programs lets you take a ton of CS courses and you'll probably end with around 2x times CS credits as an MEng student. Also, the cost can be alleviated somewhat via scholarship. I received a $30,000 scholarship and I know others have received up to $50,0000. So for me, since I think internship is extremely important, the CM program was a no-brainer."

I'm very excited, there are not many people who study CS at a top institution in the US or CAN, I can't believe the number of excellent students from Asia that apply for the most competitive programs.

And TTPB about international students: with me, now there are several on this list. Only evidence thus far is US undergrads, but hard to get a complete view when they only admit like 25 people and not everyone is on here. And with those numbers, of course they're going to turn down amazing applicants, too!"

"TTPB asking about the acceptance rate. This year they had an acceptance rate of ~14% (I was on the admitted student webinar and they informed this thing to us on the webinar; there were many questions asked on this) probably because of Covid I presume (they might have had even lower acceptance rate before I guess). They are very selective and being an IVY league they tend to reject many deserving applications (many people on gradcafe have highlighted this thing over and over again; I agree with this), I have friends who deserved admission but were rejected. Moreover, it is difficult to predict chances of admission to top 20 unis even if you have a solid profile. For instance, I have a Granted Patent as the first inventor, Publication in Q1 IEEE journal (IEEE Access; First and only author), Published over 8 papers in springer (all as first author), produced my own security protocols which received the status of Granted Software Copyrights, Did research internship in DRDO (Indian Defence) and was an external reviewer for IEEE Access. I had a GPA of 8.97 from top Indian Private Institute, had strong recommendation letters (all highlighting my research capabilities), and solid background in security. I applied to 7 unis and was accepted to CMU, UCLA, NYU, USC, Columbia for computer science and got rejected from JHU, UofC. Although, the programs I was accepted to are better than JHU and UofC, my point is that no one can predict there chances of admission to top unis. It is very likely that you get rejected from your safe choice and accepted to your dream school. I will be attending Columbia over all the other offers as Columbia is my dream school. For others waiting, I know few people who are on the same boat, I guess they will announce something very soon. I am very pissed as of why they have not yet released the results. I am waiting for my best friend to get accepted so that we can go together, that's the reason I kind of check the gradcafe website everyday. I feel they are waiting for students to update the university if they cannot make it to Columbia in fall or spring so that they can release the results. In there recent email to the admitted students they had this in the email: ""If you are no longer planning to enroll at Columbia in either Fall or Spring, please let me know right away."" I hope this gives you some clarity! Because I feel there is still some hope! All the best to others who are waiting!"

Finally got the result. I contacted USC about updating(defer) my admission for Fall 2021 and they replied saying that people who were waitlisted don't get to defer and that we need to reapply if we want to be considered for Fall 2021. I am not sure what decision I will make.

"Finally. Fucking finally, after waiting for 218 days I can get closure. They said that I\'m academically eligible to get in, they\'ll send the official admit letter by July 15 when I demonstrate proof of ability to pay tuition and living expenses. The mail also says I gotta pay $500 as commitment deposit by July 31 if I choose the offer. I didn\'t visit the USC Graduate websites for info, but the mail I got says I got 2 options â€” Fall 2020 in-person, or Fall 2020 online followed by Spring in-person. On visiting their ""Newly Admitted"" website however, I see there are 4 options -- one can even defer to Fall \'21.\r\n\r\nI\'ll probably reject the offer, it\'s way too costly -- living expenses, and everything else included. I already have 2 just as good offers (with scholarship). \r\nTo those reading â€” if you\'re accepted, good for you, really. If you were rejected after all this wait, you have me on your side too. USC will always be \""Uni of Stupid Cunts\"" or \""Uni of Spoilt Children\"" for me.\r\nCheers."

TTPB: The acceptance rate is usually between 25-40 percent. However only a VERY small fraction of the admitted people actually attend the program which means most kids put this as a backup choice.

I have ""so called"" decent or mediocre profile that you say, but got into these schools. It's not because the schools have sh*t process but your CV and SOP is full of b*llsh*t and they know how to distinguish it. No use of blaming the schools that rejected you and denounce the accepted. Do not try to rationalize or justify yourself by denigrating the others."

It's said they have reviewed all applications on March 30, and all results will be demonstrated before April 2. It is possible that if you academic plan changed to MS, you would be admitted to MS program. Since I heard my friend got rejected with academic plan still showing PhD and MS."

"To the one who asked about MILA: It is obvious that MILA is a great research community that has many world-renowned members in the field of RL such as prof. Doina Precup. However, it can not be considered as a Reinforcement Learning research group because, due to the information given on their website, their main focus is on applications of deep learning. Hence, I believe that it is not right to compare these two research groups with each other in the base of which one is the best RL group."

"TTPB: That is not true. I got accepted by UIUC, UCSD. But rejected by wisconsin, purdue. I think the process is a lot based on luck. Sometimes the reviewers don't even read applications properly. There are just too many applications. And on average profs dont spend more than 1-2mins on a single application. This includes reviewing your LORs, SOPs, Resume. Just to inform last year I applied with the exact same SOP, LORs and got accepted by Wisconsin. And I am sure if a lot of you guys apply again the results will be different. Its unfair, but it what it is."

"Aiming for NLP/HLT concentration. Some research and short publications in another field, with one research project in NLP. First admit, hope is not lost! Cloned my JHU PhD application to this program. I intend to ask advising this, but any thoughts on how well the JHU MS stacks for PhD application prep? Seems my big shortcoming is lack of extensive research experience in NLP, want to make sure this is a sound approach for closing the gap before investing so much time and money"

Besides the school isnt too selective so you should have a decent shot. I myself am gonna most probably accept it with the next 4 days.

"Graduated from top Canadian university with above-average GPA and several years of industrial experience. Had taken one NDO course at Stanford before (got A-) and got V730/Q800 before applying in 2010. Thought that was good enough but was rejected on the first try. Took two more Stanford NDO courses (got A+ on both) and took 2 months off work to volunteer on an academic research project last year and re-applied. Finally got in. To those of you who aren't so fortunate this year but are determined to re-try - despair not, take more courses and perseverance will deliver!"

By the way, for anyone in the future who is worried about a low GRE Verbal score affecting chances of admissions -- DON'T! I thought a 460 Verbal would ruin my chances at top programs, but apparently all of the programs were able to overlook it. Best of luck to you!"

I know CMU is very strong in CS and hard to get into (for some of its finest programs), but I'm not very familiar with UCSD and hence the question. Has it got a nitch for your area of study or is its MSCS program really a good one?"

My background is Vision and ML and I have done a significant amount of research already at IIITH. Iâ€™m mostly not gonna do a PhD and wanna work in a good R&D role. I am currently inclined towards GaTech, I just wanted to make sure Iâ€™m not making a mistake because UCSD also seems really good. Thanks in advance!"

I am not sure if there will be any third round or not in the upcoming weeks (I have no idea), however with the initial notification they tell you to provide them with your decision no later than three weeks from the time of receiving that notification, which means they will be sending out rebound admissions on March 25th (last week) and April 8th(next two weeks). This was all I knew. Good Luck."

"I got an email on 04/05/2019 informing me of my acceptance. I am a working professional so I actually applied to the professional Master's program (part-time) and not the full-time program on campus. Does anybody have any input or say on this program? Is it reputable and worth all the money? It appears to be much easier to get accepted than the full-time program and it's taught my tech leaders and not necessarily research professors. The application process was free and does not even require GRE! Let me know what you guys think, thanks!"

Research experience at Google HQ. 333 GRE, 115 TOEFL,decent GPA. So happy these folks don't just go by the prestige of the undergrad college but value other just as important things too."

Specialization: Cybersecurity; MS in Information Systems & Security with a GPA of 3.9; Adjunct teaching at a private university (2.5 years); BU called me asking why my GRE scores were so low and did not measure to my grades in undergrad/graduate school. I told them that I just went and took it as I knew a standardized test could not show my performance in graduate school. They stated that is what they thought and then accepted me on the spot with an assistantship. - Just shows that the GRE is not the end of all things.

Cornell Undergrad with Business major (Dyson) and CS minor. For future applicants with questions about the interview: - lasted 30 min. over Skype with a professor in the specific field that I mentioned being interested in. - some technical questions but not very difficult if you have a good base + if you're lacking in some area you should just admit you don't know and they'll assign you to an online summer class before starting. Honesty is the best policy ;) - mostly questions about why Cornell Tech and why CS. The program is pretty different from other Masters programs so you should have a good reason why you are attracted to this specific structure and set of classes. - was told that I should receive an offer at the end of the interview and received the official acceptance letter exactly 2 weeks later
