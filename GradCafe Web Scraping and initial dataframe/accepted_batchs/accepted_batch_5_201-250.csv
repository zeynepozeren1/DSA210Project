"TTPB: That is not true. I got accepted by UIUC, UCSD. But rejected by wisconsin, purdue. I think the process is a lot based on luck. Sometimes the reviewers don't even read applications properly. There are just too many applications. And on average profs dont spend more than 1-2mins on a single application. This includes reviewing your LORs, SOPs, Resume. Just to inform last year I applied with the exact same SOP, LORs and got accepted by Wisconsin. And I am sure if a lot of you guys apply again the results will be different. Its unfair, but it what it is."

Cloned my JHU PhD application to this program. I intend to ask advising this, but any thoughts on how well the JHU MS stacks for PhD application prep? Seems my big shortcoming is lack of extensive research experience in NLP, want to make sure this is a sound approach for closing the gap before investing so much time and money"

My profile: 1 Granted Patent, 9 First Author Publications (Mostly in tier - 1 and tier 2 journals; IEEE Access, Wireless Networks, etc.), 3 Granted Software Copyrights, External Reviewer for IEEE Access, 2 Articles about me in news media, 1 Pending Patent, 1 Prestigious internship at Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), India.

"Italian student from good university (not a polytechnic). High GPA, 29.3/30. Good recommendation letters, no research experience (I hadn't started my thesis yet when I applied), some CS-related extracurricular experiences. Absolutely terrible SOP, but as one can guess it has little to no weight. Obviously no GRE since it's not needed for European students."

To the Poster for USC below. Funny thing is I really dont have an accept deadline. So no dont assume you are rejected. I have heard success stories in USC even uptil late May. Besides the school isnt too selective so you should have a decent shot. I myself am gonna most probably accept it with the next 4 days.
