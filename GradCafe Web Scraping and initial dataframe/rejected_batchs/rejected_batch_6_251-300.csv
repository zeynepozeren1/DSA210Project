"The Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University has completed its evaluation of applications to Masters Program for the Fall of 2010, and it is with great regret that I must inform you that your application could not be included among our acceptances. To deny admission is an unhappy business, as much for those responsible for the decision as for the candidate who is turned away. The great majority of men and women who applied to the MHCI this year are clearly capable of performing well academically and of making significant contributions to the college community. The Board's task in selecting this year's class has been extremely difficult. We want to acknowledge your accomplishments and we want you to understand how much care we have taken in the admission process to get to know all of our applicants. It was a very difficult decision to make. We wanted to make sure you heard from us in a timely fashion, hence this email. Although you may be disappointed by our decision, remember that in the long run where you go to graduate school is far less important than what you do with the opportunities that will come your way. Please know you have my best wishes for success in your career plans. With warm regards, Jenna Date Director of the MHCI Program Human-Computer Interaction Institute Carnegie Mellon University"

"I regret to inform you that we are unable to admit you to the M.S. in Language and Information Technologies program at Carnegie Mellon. We received over 1700 applications this year. Our graduate programs can support only a limited number of new students. Unfortunately, we could admit only a fraction of the applicants, even though many more had strong qualifications.

We regret to inform you that the Department of Computer Sciences will not be able to offer you admission to the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. We received nearly 1000 applications this year and the qualifications of all candidates (including yours) were very high. A committee of over 20 people carefully reviewed the applications and had to make the very difficult decisions of whom to admit.

"Was written in the rejection mail. For applications from India, we accepted: CGPA of 8.0 and above from top tier Institutes (very few exceptions were made); CGPA of 8.5 and higher of tier II institutes; CGPA of 9.0 and higher of tier III institutes Should have mentioned it in the application requirements. Would have saved few USD for some other university. So much for evaluations holistically."
