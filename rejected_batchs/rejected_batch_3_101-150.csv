"As much as I hate to admit it, but I, too, confirmed it with their program coordinator whose name other people have mentioned. They indeed sent out all positive notifications and only rejections remain now (official rejection emails will be sent out in April). Quite bummed out because I was hopeful of an admit. Felt my profile was good enough for Purdue."

"To the person who said Princeton was not selecting International students in 2021-22 because of Covid. I have noticed this problem with multiple US univs, all of whom are more than happy to get you for a paid course but not for a funded course. Wisconsin being a primary example. Princeton has relatively very less seats than Madisson. So my guess is that this year even TA RA chances might wither and internationals are going to fund US economy by going for masters there."

"3.85 UG GPA from a well-regarded school, top ten for CS worldwide. 3 publications, 2 first author to a big journal and a T2 conference. Lots of volunteer tutoring and TA experience. no GRE. international competitive athlete while in UG. Not sure what the deal is, maybe my statement didn't align with any faculty research? I thought I mentioned areas of interest that aligned with Princeton profs' research. Maybe it was just a competitive year. Admission to ivys can seem random at times, wishing the best to those who were accepted, I am sure most of the applicants were deserving of acceptance."

Rejected from the cash cow professional CS program. Did my undergrad at a way higher ranked university in CS (Top 10 USNews). What a complete joke. Never would have gone even if they accepted me since it would only weaken my resume.

Don't really care... They waited me wait for so long I lost interest in them... I actually feel that they will reject you to lower the acceptance rate... Many people who deserved a seat got rejected... Don't worry guys just cuz you didn't get in doesn't mean you're not qualified... All the best to all!!! And hope that this decision doesn't depress you much!!!
