"To the post below, I'm quite curious what is your reason for (potentially) choosing UCSD over CMU? I know CMU is very strong in CS and hard to get into (for some of its finest programs), but I'm not very familiar with UCSD and hence the question. Has it got a nitch for your area of study or is its MSCS program really a good one?"

"I submitted app in late February; one of my recommenders did not submit letter until late March. @previous posters: they release admissions decisions in batches, April 1 being one of the notification dates; August 1 is the latest possible notification date. However, I don't know if they release decisions on the 1st of every month, and I don't know how they group the applications they're considering at any given time. Also, there was no information about financial aid included with acceptance--has anyone else received this info? I've been accepted elsewhere and need to make a decision by April 15th, and the financial aid package is crucial information..."

"Hi everyone, congrats on your admits. Iâ€™m quite confused and I wanna decide on an admit and decline the rest asap. I would really appreciate your advice. I got into GaTech, UCSD and UMass MSCS. My background is Vision and ML and I have done a significant amount of research already at IIITH. Iâ€™m mostly not gonna do a PhD and wanna work in a good R&D role. I am currently inclined towards GaTech, I just wanted to make sure Iâ€™m not making a mistake because UCSD also seems really good. Thanks in advance!"

"To the Alberta poster below: they have sent out first round admissions on March 3rd and 4th. The professor I have been in contact with, told me I was gonna be admitted on the second round, which I got the initial notification on March 18th. I am not sure if there will be any third round or not in the upcoming weeks (I have no idea), however with the initial notification they tell you to provide them with your decision no later than three weeks from the time of receiving that notification, which means they will be sending out rebound admissions on March 25th (last week) and April 8th(next two weeks). This was all I knew. Good Luck."
