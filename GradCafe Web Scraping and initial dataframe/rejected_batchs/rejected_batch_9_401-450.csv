"GPA is all that seems to matter.. I have seen multiple ""insert embarrassingly high 9.xx GPA"" from shitty Tier-3 colleges in India getting admitted. I have a decent GPA from a Tier-1 college (With relative grading, it is actually hard for us to score >9 GPA - they don't distribute those like peanuts).. UW-M was a great college and hence my bitter rant.. Anyways, nice to have some closure.."
