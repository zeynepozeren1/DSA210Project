"My undergrad was not in Computer Science, it was in Biology. However, I had a significant focus on bioinformatics (coursework, 2 summer internships, and a senior thesis) and I'd gotten a minor in CS / taken most of the basic core CS courses (Data Structures, Algorithms, etc.) as part of it. I had to do a one-way video interview which I felt like I botched but made it through and a brief technical assessment (randomized questions on a variety of topics; not too difficult if you've had any exposure to CS) because I didn't major in CS."

Kind of happy for the admit. I am skill sceptical about how good the program is. Can any one tell me how good are the courses and how are PMP students differentiated from regular MS students. 2. Job opportunities ? This program is specifically made for Industry oriented students; how well do students get placed here ?

"Rejected from PhD, accepted to MS program. No funding, but recommended for TAship. Don't know how I got in at all with such a crap GPA...rejected from other lower-ranked CS programs. 3 good lor, good sop, research experience; 1 2nd author applied ml research article in mediocre journal, several unpublished and ""in submission"" projects, had interview with a prof. Just got lucky I guess - I think I was considered a wildcard admit. Some more transcript info: C + and an F in 5 honors math courses, C in advanced algorithms, As in 3 graduate machine learning courses and TA for machine learning/AI courses for 4 semesters. Other admits include WashU (PhD CS), U Wisconsin (MS in Bioinformatics), Stony Brook (MS CS), University of Rochester (MS CS). Rejects include NYU, UC Berkeley (lol), U Washington (lol), UC SB, TTIC, University of Chicago. I will choose this program."

"I also have and admit from CMU MCDS. Really confused between the two primarily because though CMU has a huge brand name and a good course structure for MCDS, I've head it gets quite hectic since I'll be taking 4 courses per semester in order to complete the requirements in 16 months. There is a 20 month option as well but I don't think its worth the extra $40k. Apart from being a well renowned university for MS CS, I really like the course structure at Georgia Tech too give that the program spans 2 years, I can engage in research work as well. I'd be grateful if anyone of you could give your inputs which will help me in making a proper decision! Thank you :)"
