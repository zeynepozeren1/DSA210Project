"Is it even possible for an 'I' student from India to get into top universities without publications. I have heard from my under-grad mates who are graduating currently that students from other countries have it pretty easy during admission process because of the cultural diversity BS that univ check. They get admitted with super-low GRE, low GPA, no publ and weak SOP, and here you need to get all 4 or your application is going in trash."
