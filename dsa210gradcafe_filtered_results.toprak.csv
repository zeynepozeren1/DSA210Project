I applied mainly to PhD programs this round; and this was my only MS application and also my only acceptance (!!). I'm applying straight from undergrad at Berkeley with an unconventional interdisciplinary CS-focused background. I thought that that would be a turn-off but I guess they liked it? I also got a TAship that covers tuition plus a $12;900/quarter salary. I had 4 significant research experiences throughout undergrad; 2 were in CS but not super technical and all were CS-adjacent. I had 1 first-author paper at an ACM conference which won Best Paper; and I had another one in preparation at the time of the application (currently have 4 in prep; 1 under review).

McGill University Computer Science Masters April 29; 2021 Rejected on 29 Apr Total comments Open options Fall 2021 International GPA 3.70 First off; this year they had to review nearly 2000 applicants and therefore; from my perspective; it's nearly impossible for them to review each and every candidate (Due to showing 'submitted' on majority of candidate's status). Secondly; the students who got in have been in touch with one/two Profs and after an interview; they may / may be not get into the program. So from my standpoint; this year is going to be a mass rejection in this department!! Because;" a lot of students from last year have ""DEFERRED"" their 2020 admission to 2021!!!";;;;;;;

I have a nice work experience; one year and a half in the nanosatellite industry in NanosatLab UPC; developing a PCB design to keep the communication between internal devices of a nanosatellite always active. I am also developing a system in C language to determine the attitude of the satellite in the space; this information is taken from the sensors and processed with control theory (we use quaternions); and later on this information is used to correct the position of the satellite. I am also going to do an internship in a satellite enterprise here in Barcelona to further my knowledge in the mentioned fields. I am graduating next year but I have calculated my approximate GPA and I can assure that my TOEFL exam will exceed by far the minimal requirement. Last but not least; I can get very nice recommendation letters from well known teachers here at UPC (Polytechnic University of Catalonia). I want to know my chances to get into a master's in UH; ASU; UIC; FIU; CSULB; CSUSLO; CSULA and UTSA.;;
