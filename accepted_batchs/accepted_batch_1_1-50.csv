"Warning: From my personal experience, Ron Fedkiw at Stanford CS is a toxic advisor and a textbook narcissist, very self-centered and obsessed with control. None of his current students has even one paper published with him during their 3-10 years of time in his lab. Some of them have graduated with only arXiv papers. He has now quit Stanford due to a conflict with the department."

"From a German university, but not a highly ranked one like TUM or KIT (QS around 450). TOEFL 106. Two letters of recommendation—one might be strong, but I’m not sure what ""strong"" means in this context. Research experience includes a research internship at MPI, one year as a TA, and one year working at a research institution. Started working in a lab this fall. My Statement of Purpose might have been good, but I have no real benchmark for comparison. Honestly, I didn’t expect to get in, especially after reading the rejections here. My grades are generally strong, but my transcript isn’t perfect—there’s a small note, more of a detail, that I thought might get me rejected. My worst grades (2.0 and 1.7) are in math-related subjects, so I was worried that might hurt my chances. Still a bit surprised, but I’m excited for the opportunity and will do my best!

"This is for an MS in CS (for S&E). BA in Statistics from a Top 5 US public school, with all A's in CS courses like ds&a, OS, DB, AI, etc. No published research but a strong undergrad honors thesis in statistical machine learning, and a few decent projects in deep learning and computer vision. About 2 years of experience in startups and Big 4 consulting. Program-tailored SoP, though written in one night so not perfect. 1 LoR from a manager. The program targets engineering or science majors, but seems open to others with relevant experience or coursework in computing."

"First off, I want to formally thank my close freinds, advisors, and mentors for believing. I want to especially thank my mom. She worked double shifts just to keep a roof over my sisters and I ever the past few years. Second, I'd like to say FUCK YOU to all the people who said I wasn't â€œsmart enoughâ€ or said my goals were too high for my expectations. Your skepticism and negative treatment only fueled my determination. Third, I'd like to say a special huge GO FUCK YOURSELF to one of my high school teachers and to one of my EECS Professors at Berkeley. Both of you doubted my abilities and underestimated my abilities as a student, particularly highlighting both of my physical and health challenges as a barrier to my success in the engineering field. You thought that being in a wheelchair would prevent me from achieving milestones in my life. You would have never thought a guy in a wheelchair could BOTH get a job at Google w/ a 6-fig salary AND get into Stanford Graduate Engineering school in the same month. WELL GUESS WHAT BITCHES.Â I DID IT. LOOK WHOSE WINNING NOW. ðŸ–•ðŸ˜¤ðŸ–• (mic drop)"

People look up to those who attended prestigious institutes , but little do they know that there are several more who are capable of attending them but are not able afford them. A handful take huge loans with hopes that some company will hire them with enough salary to help payback that loan. What abt those who arent willling to take on a huge loan and rely on the university's tag? their skills are pretty much the same regardless of whether or not they attend the institution.
