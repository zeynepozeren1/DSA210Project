"I got an email with an unofficial acceptance today for the MS CS program. It gives me a link to accept or reject, but yet it says it has not been approved yet? Congratulations! We are pleased to inform you that you are being recommended for admission to the Department of Computer Science - Master of Science (MS) program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign beginning with the Fall 2021 term. With successful completion of the MS program, you can apply to continue on for the PhD program. We believe that our graduate program can provide an excellent environment for your graduate studies. At this time, we are unable to guarantee any funding assistance. There may be a possibility to secure a teaching or research assistantship pending availability for this upcoming academic year. There are other units on campus that may be offering assistantships if you are looking for one. Below is the link that may be of assistance in locating an assistantship or hourly employment prior to arriving to campus. Application for financial assistance always exceeds our departmental resources making it impossible to offer aid to all qualified applicants. Assistantship Clearinghouse (www.grad.illinois.edu/clearinghouse) If this recommendation for admission is approved by the Graduate College at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, you will receive an offer of admission from the Graduate College. Please inform us of your decision regarding this offer of admission at the following link by Thursday, April 15, 2021:"

"Australian university without honours (3 year degree). 93.6 average mark, from what I know basically top 3 in course (~600 people). 167/169/4.5. 2 summer research in Med Phys, resulting in first author in to-be-published paper in top journal, another half a year doing compsci reserach (around 1.5yrs in total). Good SoP (did my research on the uni), decent LoR (1 from deputy dean of compsci, 1 from my reserach supervisor). Participated and won a few hackathons, top 5 in regional finals for ICPC, and some high impact awards at international level in high school. I thought lack of honors would disadvantage me, but clearly not. The long wait between results was killing me, thought I was a goner for sure. This is my top choice, since lack of honors means I cannot apply for US unis nor PhDs, and this is the best masters program out of all others."

The first is the behaviour interview, which lasts for an hour (basically the POI talked for 45 mins and I talked for 15 mins...). The second is a technical interview; I present the papers that I co-authored, and the POI asked a bunch of problems, which last for three hours... and was told (and emailed) by the POI that he will accept me. The official offer will take one week to be available. I will accept the offer since the POI and UWaterloo are my top choice! Also admitted by a Ph.D. program in the states, but I am worried about the strict and unclear immigration policy, so I would rather not risk it, thus will decline."

"TTPB: I was accepted to the Connective Media program and I also had a hard time choosing between the two. The biggest difference is the length as you mentioned. The MEng program is 9 months with no option to extend. This means you'll be looking for a full time role as soon as you start with no internship opportunities. The CM program is 2 years and obviously has an internship opportunity which is a HUGE pro as you can imagine. Further, the CM programs lets you take a ton of CS courses and you'll probably end with around 2x times CS credits as an MEng student. Also, the cost can be alleviated somewhat via scholarship. I received a $30,000 scholarship and I know others have received up to $50,0000. So for me, since I think internship is extremely important, the CM program was a no-brainer."

"Interviewed last week of February. Decision arrived a week later. I wasn't sure about my odds because I'm in my mid 30s, yet I have 7 years of work exp. as I cofounded a 40 person tech startup in Mexico when I was 28 y/o and I was in the top 5% of my undergrad at ITESM Monterrey. I'm very excited, there are not many people who study CS at a top institution in the US or CAN, I can't believe the number of excellent students from Asia that apply for the most competitive programs. I was also accepted at Imperial College London but most prob. I will take UofT. For those of you above 30 y/o reading this, if you wanna apply don't hesitate."

I had asked a prof there about my chances and they told me their admit cap was less than 3% of the applicants, so I didn't expect this. Thrilled to get in! And TTPB about international students: with me, now there are several on this list. Only evidence thus far is US undergrads, but hard to get a complete view when they only admit like 25 people and not everyone is on here. And with those numbers, of course they're going to turn down amazing applicants, too!"

I was accepted into the Summer 2020 program, but I chose the option to defer to Spring 2021. I submitted my term update request in which USC replied, ""your decision for Spring 2021, which will remain the same as for Summer 2020, will be issued by July 17th."" I have not received this email.

"TTPB asking about the acceptance rate. This year they had an acceptance rate of ~14% (I was on the admitted student webinar and they informed this thing to us on the webinar; there were many questions asked on this) probably because of Covid I presume (they might have had even lower acceptance rate before I guess). They are very selective and being an IVY league they tend to reject many deserving applications (many people on gradcafe have highlighted this thing over and over again; I agree with this), I have friends who deserved admission but were rejected. Moreover, it is difficult to predict chances of admission to top 20 unis even if you have a solid profile. For instance, I have a Granted Patent as the first inventor, Publication in Q1 IEEE journal (IEEE Access; First and only author), Published over 8 papers in springer (all as first author), produced my own security protocols which received the status of Granted Software Copyrights, Did research internship in DRDO (Indian Defence) and was an external reviewer for IEEE Access. I had a GPA of 8.97 from top Indian Private Institute, had strong recommendation letters (all highlighting my research capabilities), and solid background in security. I applied to 7 unis and was accepted to CMU, UCLA, NYU, USC, Columbia for computer science and got rejected from JHU, UofC. Although, the programs I was accepted to are better than JHU and UofC, my point is that no one can predict there chances of admission to top unis. It is very likely that you get rejected from your safe choice and accepted to your dream school. I will be attending Columbia over all the other offers as Columbia is my dream school. For others waiting, I know few people who are on the same boat, I guess they will announce something very soon. I am very pissed as of why they have not yet released the results. I am waiting for my best friend to get accepted so that we can go together, that's the reason I kind of check the gradcafe website everyday. I feel they are waiting for students to update the university if they cannot make it to Columbia in fall or spring so that they can release the results. In there recent email to the admitted students they had this in the email: ""If you are no longer planning to enroll at Columbia in either Fall or Spring, please let me know right away."" I hope this gives you some clarity! Because I feel there is still some hope! All the best to others who are waiting!"

"Finally. Fucking finally, after waiting for 218 days I can get closure. They said that I\'m academically eligible to get in, they\'ll send the official admit letter by July 15 when I demonstrate proof of ability to pay tuition and living expenses. The mail also says I gotta pay $500 as commitment deposit by July 31 if I choose the offer. I didn\'t visit the USC Graduate websites for info, but the mail I got says I got 2 options â€” Fall 2020 in-person, or Fall 2020 online followed by Spring in-person. On visiting their ""Newly Admitted"" website however, I see there are 4 options -- one can even defer to Fall \'21.\r\n\r\nI\'ll probably reject the offer, it\'s way too costly -- living expenses, and everything else included. I already have 2 just as good offers (with scholarship). \r\nTo those reading â€” if you\'re accepted, good for you, really. If you were rejected after all this wait, you have me on your side too. USC will always be \""Uni of Stupid Cunts\"" or \""Uni of Spoilt Children\"" for me.\r\nCheers."

"I received an acceptance around the end of Feb but haven't been able to know since then, the exact date, by when we are supposed to respond back with our decision. I even mailed Tom Hurst to check an exact date/deadline to respond back with our decision but he responded back saying anytime before the beginning of Summer instead of mentioning an exact date. Does anyone here (may have also received an acceptance from UMD) know about the exact date/deadline to respond back with our decision?"

March 29 academic plan changed from PhD and MS to only MS. March 30 spire status changed to ""update pending"", April 1 received an email of status change, April 2 log in to spire and found accepted. It's said they have reviewed all applications on March 30, and all results will be demonstrated before April 2. It is possible that if you academic plan changed to MS, you would be admitted to MS program. Since I heard my friend got rejected with academic plan still showing PhD and MS."
