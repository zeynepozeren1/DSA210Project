"I just want to say, don't listen to the admission office. He's there to discourage you. I called the CS admission office asking about the paper works and he said ""our admission process is very selective, your chance of getting in is very low"" He kept saying that 3-4 times, even though I didn't ask him about my chance. I have a low GRE score, but my grade is very high (almost the top 5% of my class) and my work experience is related to their research. The professor that wrote me a letter of rec has some close contact with ETH professors too. Maybe that helped me get in. I'm from the US btw."

"I'm in shock... I applied mainly to PhD programs this round, and this was my only MS application and also my only acceptance (!!). I'm applying straight from undergrad at Berkeley with an unconventional interdisciplinary CS-focused background. I thought that that would be a turn-off but I guess they liked it? I also got a TAship that covers tuition plus a $12,900/quarter salary. I had 4 significant research experiences throughout undergrad, 2 were in CS but not super technical and all were CS-adjacent. I had 1 first-author paper at an ACM conference which won Best Paper, and I had another one in preparation at the time of the application (currently have 4 in prep, 1 under review). Did not submit GRE."

"Hey I am Prathamesh and currently I'm pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Fall 22) It has been a little over a year since I began the application process, and as I remember it to be, it was constantly one task after another. Being an international student there were a lot of variables at play and tackling all of them can become intimidating. To provide more clarity, I've attempted to write a rather detailed, end-to-end article around the whole process. It's something I was looking for last year, for myself, but couldn't find. Hope it adds some value for those of you who plan on going for Masters in the near future. Article: https://medium.com/@prathameshsonawane/how-what-when-a-guide-to-ms-923b456c0560"
