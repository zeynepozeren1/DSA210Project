"Dual BS Degrees in Electrical Engineering (honors program) and Mechanical Engineering. Several years of TA experience and extracurriculars. 3 years SWE experience post undergrad. Took a few classes in the Georgia Tech OMSCS program before applying. Rejected from the MSCS program after applying before the priority deadline. Opted to be considered for the Bridge if not admitted for the MSCS. Rejected read as follows: After careful evaluation of your application to the Computer Science Master of Science program for the Fall 2024 term, the Committee on Admissions at The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science regrets to inform you that your application has not been approved. You will not be considered for any additional degree programs for the Fall 2024 term. I am curious about the ""You will not be considered for any additional degree programs for the Fall 2024 term"" though. Is it normal to have that in the rejection letter? I wonder if my application was disqualified because some of my rec letters or my video interview were submitted a little late."

Do not apply to stony if you have Quant below 165. It is very quant centric and GRE focused. Even 165 sometimes don't stand a chance. 167+ is ideal. Your Verbal score doesn't matter much. People with same score but higher in quant and lesser in verbal have the admit.

"I was hoping that good news would come from all the waiting. However, I could not have been more wrong, and it blows; UCSD is my dream school. Moreover, I am a recently separated US Navy veteran who worked in cryptology for close to 4 years. I have no published papers and did not go to a top university; however, I had three strong letters of recommendation, a strong SOP, a solid GPA, immense drive, dedication, and proven work experience, which I hoped would lead to acceptance. But, in the end, it wasn't enough. (Although I am very happy for all those who were accepted and hope all the hard work pays off!) P.S. While looking over the UCSD website and after contacting them about the university's demographics out of pure curiosity, I am unsure if they actually consider and or accept veterans. Additionally, when I asked how many actual veterans (those who served, not family members) attend, they said they do not have the information to give. So, if you're a veteran and find yourself curious about the inclusivity of this university, keep this in mind: you might not be as important of a consideration as others, and apparently, you have to be okay with it."

"International student, four internships at Big Techs, one year of work experience, two weak publications, 2 of those Big Tech internships were on research teams, a recommendation letter from Stanford Ph.D. (previous manager), a strong recommendation from a professor at Uni and a previous manager at Big tech. Idk, I am kind of disappointed I didn't get in. I know it is highly competitive and stuff, but I prepared so hard for this. I have a great resume, but I come from a very bad university in Latin America if you compare to any other of those US universities. Not sure if this may have had anything to do with it (maybe I had a bad application and just did not realize hahaha), but I wish I could know what they took into account in their decision. Well, congrats to those who were accepted; you should be really proud of yourself. I hope you guys enjoy your time at Stanford!"

"MLT I regret to inform you that we are unable to admit you into the M.S. in Language Technologies program in the Language Technologies Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. We received over 750 graduate applications this year in Language Technologies, a large percentage of which are highly qualified. However, our graduate program can support only a limited number of new students. This makes our decision very difficult, as we have to turn down many promising applicants. Unfortunately, we could not admit all applicants despite very good academic records and supporting letters. We hope you have been accepted by another graduate program of your choice, and wish you the best in your career."

"Waitlisted for MSML. Received the rejection today: ""I regret to inform you that we are unable to admit you to the Master of Science in Machine Learning program at Carnegie Mellon University. As indicated in my previous emails, your application was very strong and we reached this decision due to our program being capped at just 35 students out of an applicant pool of over 1200. Our yield this year was higher than usual and so we were unfortunately not able to admit anyone from our waitlist. Thank you again for your patience, understanding, and assistance during the long admissions process, and once again, we are sorry you were not included in the admitted students.

Just got an email at 6:30PM EST saying they did not recommend me for admission. 3.92 GPA Math and CS major from a public uni. 1 NLP publication. 3 years of work experience. Poured my heart out for the SOP so rejection hurt so bad :( I guess I will be going to Berkeley instead

Rejected from the MS CS program. I have an undergraduate degree in CS from a large state school. I have 2 years of undergraduate research experience. Decent SOP and 3 good LORs from faculty members I worked with. Likely was rejected due to having only one publication as well as not being a great fit with potential advisors. Congratulations to everyone who got in!

"First off, this year they had to review nearly 2000 applicants and therefore, from my perspective, it's nearly impossible for them to review each and every candidate (Due to showing 'submitted' on majority of candidate's status). Secondly, the students who got in have been in touch with one/two Profs and after an interview, they may / may be not get into the program. So from my standpoint, this year is going to be a mass rejection in this department!! Because, a lot of students from last year have ""DEFERRED"" their 2020 admission to 2021!!!"

"As much as I hate to admit it, but I, too, confirmed it with their program coordinator whose name other people have mentioned. They indeed sent out all positive notifications and only rejections remain now (official rejection emails will be sent out in April). Quite bummed out because I was hopeful of an admit. Felt my profile was good enough for Purdue."

"To the person who said Princeton was not selecting International students in 2021-22 because of Covid. I have noticed this problem with multiple US univs, all of whom are more than happy to get you for a paid course but not for a funded course. Wisconsin being a primary example. Princeton has relatively very less seats than Madisson. So my guess is that this year even TA RA chances might wither and internationals are going to fund US economy by going for masters there."

"3.85 UG GPA from a well-regarded school, top ten for CS worldwide. 3 publications, 2 first author to a big journal and a T2 conference. Lots of volunteer tutoring and TA experience. no GRE. international competitive athlete while in UG. Not sure what the deal is, maybe my statement didn't align with any faculty research? I thought I mentioned areas of interest that aligned with Princeton profs' research. Maybe it was just a competitive year. Admission to ivys can seem random at times, wishing the best to those who were accepted, I am sure most of the applicants were deserving of acceptance."

Don't really care... They waited me wait for so long I lost interest in them... I actually feel that they will reject you to lower the acceptance rate... Many people who deserved a seat got rejected... Don't worry guys just cuz you didn't get in doesn't mean you're not qualified... All the best to all!!! And hope that this decision doesn't depress you much!!!

"Undergraduate Student from New IIT. 9.4/10. GRE 332 (Q-170, AW - 5.5). Two papers published at okay venues and two under review at top A* conferences when submitting application. UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, Maryland, GaTech, UIUC all rejected me. Will go to ETH or UT Austin for MSCS. Probably ETH, because Corona will get out of there soon and I want to do research anyways. Had a *strong* letter from a Prof who is very famous and fellow of many fancy organisations from a top Uni in the US after my 3rd year Summer inter with him. One very strong letter from my undergrad adviser and one more letter from a prof with who I did research for a semester. Got interviews for PhD from a top school in Europe (Way above the above schools) and from 1 School in Canada (Top 4 in Canada) and 1 in USA (Top 15) - didn't make the cut anywhere. At this point, I do not simply know whatever the hell these schools need. And I haven't heard back from TAMU (Safe Option) yet! The above schools to the best of my knowledge chose a lot of people with far weaker profiles. LIFE NOW IS SHITE!"

Also, judging by the different local websites in China, there has been a clear decrease in the number of Chinese admits at UCLA and UCSD this year.

"I don't get why so many people are getting salty at the rejection. Technically UCSD ranks #9 nationwide in terms of computer science research, not to mention that their location makes them probably even more popular than Michigan or Cornell which are ahead of it. So, first of all, only the big four can be considered as ""much more competitive"" programs than UCSD. Applying to UCSD in CS master is sort of equivalent to applying to schools like UChicago or Columbia for undergrad. Anyone could get rejected and they do have the luxury to reject some of the best students. So if you're not close to perfect in BOTH grades at school, GRE and research/recommendation letters there's no way to assume that UCSD would accept you."

"This is to inform you that you have not been recommended for admission to the Computer Science Master of Science program. We receive a large number of applications each year from qualified applicants, but we can only admit a certain number. We allow a few programs to review our applicants who were not accepted to our Master of Science. Normally students cannot change their application to be considered for other programs, but this is one exception. Two programs you might consider are the MPS in Data Science and Analytics and the MPS in Machine Learning. These two programs are administered by the Science Academy and are professional programs. For more information about the Science Academy programs, please visit www.scienceacademy.umd.edu. If you would like to be considered for admission by the Data Science and Analytics or the Machine Learning program, please send an email to scienceacademy@umd.edu stating that you would like to transfer your application and clearly list which program in which you would like to be considered for admission. Please make sure that you include your University of Maryland UID and Apply Yourself (AY) Applicant ID in the correspondence. No fee will be assessed to transfer your application."

Ttpb: I got a similar mail too. From Tom. I hadn't mailed previously. Did he say they will be transferring your application to be considered for the MPS programs if you wish? Or are you already given an admit to the program?

"We received a high volume of applications this year and competition was very tough (this year's acceptance rate was approximately 11%). We regret to advise you that we are unable to offer you admission. You will receive official notification by the regular postal service. The admission decision is based on the overall evaluation of the application. This includes your statement of purpose, transcripts, CV and letters of reference, as well as an assessment of your qualifications according to the standards set by the Department of Computer Science and the School of Graduate Studies and an assessment of the potential for success in the graduate program. The Admission Committee's decision is not based on any single factor but rather on the overall evaluation of the application. The process is extremely selective as we receive many more highly-qualified applications than we can accept. Deliberations of the Graduate Admissions Committee are confidential and we are unable to accept or consider appeals of rejection."

I regret to inform you that your application for admission to the Computing Science MSc program in the School of Computing Science was unsuccessful. We received many excellent applications this year and the admissions committee that reviewed your application was unable to recommend admission. We receive far more applications for admission than we can possibly admit due to resource limitations and therefore some deserving applicants cannot be admitted. Regrettably we are not able to respond to inquiries about this decision. I would like to thank you for your interest in attending Simon Fraser University and want to wish you success in your future endeavors.

"The Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University has completed its evaluation of applications to Masters Program for the Fall of 2010, and it is with great regret that I must inform you that your application could not be included among our acceptances. To deny admission is an unhappy business, as much for those responsible for the decision as for the candidate who is turned away. The great majority of men and women who applied to the MHCI this year are clearly capable of performing well academically and of making significant contributions to the college community. The Board's task in selecting this year's class has been extremely difficult. We want to acknowledge your accomplishments and we want you to understand how much care we have taken in the admission process to get to know all of our applicants. It was a very difficult decision to make. We wanted to make sure you heard from us in a timely fashion, hence this email. Although you may be disappointed by our decision, remember that in the long run where you go to graduate school is far less important than what you do with the opportunities that will come your way. Please know you have my best wishes for success in your career plans. With warm regards, Jenna Date Director of the MHCI Program Human-Computer Interaction Institute Carnegie Mellon University"

"This is why they rejected me After careful consideration, the faculty of the program to which you applied (Computer Science - MS) has not recommended your admission. Their decision was based on the requirements of their particular program, the qualifications and performance of students currently studying in the program, and the number of new students that the program can accommodate and support. I concur with their decision and must therefore deny your admission. I dont have very impressive scores and grades"

"Is it even possible for an 'I' student from India to get into top universities without publications. I have heard from my under-grad mates who are graduating currently that students from other countries have it pretty easy during admission process because of the cultural diversity BS that univ check. They get admitted with super-low GRE, low GPA, no publ and weak SOP, and here you need to get all 4 or your application is going in trash."

"Had contacted supervisor after submitting. He agreed to supervise me and wrote ""I will submit the support letter"" in his email. However, my application got rejected. It happens... No worries. But, the reason why I am writing this message is to emphasize that unless and until you have few research papers published at some reputed international journals, there is very less chance of getting admission into Msc thesis option for cs in highly ranked university. Congratulations to those who got accepted... I hope that you will someday get Turing award and make UoA feel proud."

"Not affected even a bit, especially after looking at some of the profiles of people who got admitted. Followed thegradcafe and other forums closely over the past three months. Going by the pattern, UCSD accepted students with even average profiles (no papers, no internship / work ex, degree from not so reputed institution, bad gre score, bad gpa) but who applied as early as November. As the submission date closer to the deadline, cgpa solely (nothing else, none of the factors mentioned above, not even the undergrad major) seems to have affected the decision. Just thought everyone should know. No hard feelings though. Got into a better university. :)"

Why can't they do these things a month earlier? What is the point in sending rejections so late? My mistake. Wasted money!! Purdue is another $90 scam. They don't even mind to send rejection letters. Have better admits. LOL. UMass!! Purdue!!

Well no hard feelings at all, going to accept UCI probably anyway. Email states that the prerequisite courses and the cgpa less than 3.65 is the common reasons to not get an acceptance. I think schools I got admissions from considered my last two years gpa being really good before admitting me. CU did not care apparently. Congrats to everyone admitted! Waiting for UCSD notification right now, but expecting a reject now since it took so long."

It is certainly not a good experience. Right after the deadline, I sent multiple emails to a POI but never get response. Whenever I send an email to the admission, my email got forwarded and replied with a generic email. I also applied the MSc program, and I heard multiple people saying that the school don't accept international student this year because they don't want to fund the higher tuition. It was very risky since I have only applied two schools. But luckily, I'm going to Oxford instead."

"1st rejection hurts--and so does posting. Might get rejected at all 6 schools I applied to tbh. Applied to the MCS - Nonthesis. Info sci at a nearby school with a great tech rep. Had 2 SWE internships, an AI patent, 9 MOOCs, good LORs, and good SOP explaining how I found my passion for CS after switching from a business track and my struggles of being first gen linked with my desire to go into CS. sigh* really was hoping my achievements would outweigh my GPA."
