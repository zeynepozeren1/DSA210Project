Probably better than the rest of the lot anyways. Probably mentioning my ultimate goal was to do a PhD in all my MS SoP's was a mistake.

"Undergraduate Student from New IIT. 9.4/10. GRE 332 (Q-170, AW - 5.5). Two papers published at okay venues and two under review at top A* conferences when submitting application. UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, Maryland, GaTech, UIUC all rejected me. Will go to ETH or UT Austin for MSCS. Probably ETH, because Corona will get out of there soon and I want to do research anyways. Had a *strong* letter from a Prof who is very famous and fellow of many fancy organisations from a top Uni in the US after my 3rd year Summer inter with him. One very strong letter from my undergrad adviser and one more letter from a prof with who I did research for a semester. Got interviews for PhD from a top school in Europe (Way above the above schools) and from 1 School in Canada (Top 4 in Canada) and 1 in USA (Top 15) - didn't make the cut anywhere. At this point, I do not simply know whatever the hell these schools need. And I haven't heard back from TAMU (Safe Option) yet! The above schools to the best of my knowledge chose a lot of people with far weaker profiles. LIFE NOW IS SHITE!"

"Hey all, don't worry. I am Indian, from one of the top NITs. I am a former MITACS intern (Which means I already have 15k of funding by MITACS graduate fellowship). I have four top tier papers. Very strong GPA (topper of my class). Alberta was my safe choice. I got admission from UWisc (full funded masters), UCSD (with TA), UBC (full funded), UMaryland and UWaterloo (full funded). But rejected by Alberta. I think publications and GPA are not important for them. Keep working hard on your research. You all deserve better. Cheers."

Also, judging by the different local websites in China, there has been a clear decrease in the number of Chinese admits at UCLA and UCSD this year. I kind of got a similar impression from the Indians too. We'll see when they open up the admission stats next year or so. But I totally agree with both UCs getting better recognition these days, so it is hard."

"I don't get why so many people are getting salty at the rejection. Technically UCSD ranks #9 nationwide in terms of computer science research, not to mention that their location makes them probably even more popular than Michigan or Cornell which are ahead of it. So, first of all, only the big four can be considered as ""much more competitive"" programs than UCSD. Applying to UCSD in CS master is sort of equivalent to applying to schools like UChicago or Columbia for undergrad. Anyone could get rejected and they do have the luxury to reject some of the best students. So if you're not close to perfect in BOTH grades at school, GRE and research/recommendation letters there's no way to assume that UCSD would accept you."

"This is to inform you that you have not been recommended for admission to the Computer Science Master of Science program. We receive a large number of applications each year from qualified applicants, but we can only admit a certain number. We allow a few programs to review our applicants who were not accepted to our Master of Science. Normally students cannot change their application to be considered for other programs, but this is one exception. Two programs you might consider are the MPS in Data Science and Analytics and the MPS in Machine Learning. These two programs are administered by the Science Academy and are professional programs. For more information about the Science Academy programs, please visit www.scienceacademy.umd.edu. If you would like to be considered for admission by the Data Science and Analytics or the Machine Learning program, please send an email to scienceacademy@umd.edu stating that you would like to transfer your application and clearly list which program in which you would like to be considered for admission. Please make sure that you include your University of Maryland UID and Apply Yourself (AY) Applicant ID in the correspondence. No fee will be assessed to transfer your application."

I have a few friends from my institution with lesser GPA but have profiles targeted towards a specific professor. Me on the other hand has a profile that is not at all targeted - some research on theory, some on systems and some on ML, each with some tangible end product while the other guy has one very narrow subfield like (AI for social good type thing) and got in with no good papers and has 2 nth author workshop papers at nips and icml and i have 1 1st author paper at aaai. but okay. life is chill."
