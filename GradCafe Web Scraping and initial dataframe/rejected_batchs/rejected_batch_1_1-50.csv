"Dual BS Degrees in Electrical Engineering (honors program) and Mechanical Engineering. Several years of TA experience and extracurriculars. 3 years SWE experience post undergrad. Took a few classes in the Georgia Tech OMSCS program before applying. Rejected from the MSCS program after applying before the priority deadline. Opted to be considered for the Bridge if not admitted for the MSCS. Rejected read as follows: After careful evaluation of your application to the Computer Science Master of Science program for the Fall 2024 term, the Committee on Admissions at The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science regrets to inform you that your application has not been approved. You will not be considered for any additional degree programs for the Fall 2024 term. I am curious about the ""You will not be considered for any additional degree programs for the Fall 2024 term"" though. Is it normal to have that in the rejection letter? I wonder if my application was disqualified because some of my rec letters or my video interview were submitted a little late."

"I was hoping that good news would come from all the waiting. However, I could not have been more wrong, and it blows; UCSD is my dream school. Moreover, I am a recently separated US Navy veteran who worked in cryptology for close to 4 years. I have no published papers and did not go to a top university; however, I had three strong letters of recommendation, a strong SOP, a solid GPA, immense drive, dedication, and proven work experience, which I hoped would lead to acceptance. But, in the end, it wasn't enough. (Although I am very happy for all those who were accepted and hope all the hard work pays off!) P.S. While looking over the UCSD website and after contacting them about the university's demographics out of pure curiosity, I am unsure if they actually consider and or accept veterans. Additionally, when I asked how many actual veterans (those who served, not family members) attend, they said they do not have the information to give. So, if you're a veteran and find yourself curious about the inclusivity of this university, keep this in mind: you might not be as important of a consideration as others, and apparently, you have to be okay with it."

Decent SOP, decent recommendations, 1 very good research internship, no publications. I think low GPA is the issue. Willing to answer if anyone has questions :) Best wishes for those admitted"

"International student, four internships at Big Techs, one year of work experience, two weak publications, 2 of those Big Tech internships were on research teams, a recommendation letter from Stanford Ph.D. (previous manager), a strong recommendation from a professor at Uni and a previous manager at Big tech. Idk, I am kind of disappointed I didn't get in. I know it is highly competitive and stuff, but I prepared so hard for this. I have a great resume, but I come from a very bad university in Latin America if you compare to any other of those US universities. Not sure if this may have had anything to do with it (maybe I had a bad application and just did not realize hahaha), but I wish I could know what they took into account in their decision. Well, congrats to those who were accepted; you should be really proud of yourself. I hope you guys enjoy your time at Stanford!"
