"Had contacted supervisor after submitting. He agreed to supervise me and wrote ""I will submit the support letter"" in his email. However, my application got rejected. It happens... No worries. But, the reason why I am writing this message is to emphasize that unless and until you have few research papers published at some reputed international journals, there is very less chance of getting admission into Msc thesis option for cs in highly ranked university. Congratulations to those who got accepted... I hope that you will someday get Turing award and make UoA feel proud."

"Not affected even a bit, especially after looking at some of the profiles of people who got admitted. Followed thegradcafe and other forums closely over the past three months. Going by the pattern, UCSD accepted students with even average profiles (no papers, no internship / work ex, degree from not so reputed institution, bad gre score, bad gpa) but who applied as early as November. As the submission date closer to the deadline, cgpa solely (nothing else, none of the factors mentioned above, not even the undergrad major) seems to have affected the decision. Just thought everyone should know. No hard feelings though. Got into a better university. :)"

Well no hard feelings at all, going to accept UCI probably anyway. Email states that the prerequisite courses and the cgpa less than 3.65 is the common reasons to not get an acceptance. I think schools I got admissions from considered my last two years gpa being really good before admitting me. CU did not care apparently. Congrats to everyone admitted! Waiting for UCSD notification right now, but expecting a reject now since it took so long."

Due to the large number of applicants who entered our program in the last two years, we were restricted in the number of applicants we could accept for the current academic year. We are limited by both faculty and monetary resources. We can admit only a fraction of the many qualified applicants. Since our decisions were based on faculty specific research needs and due to the large volume of applications we receive, we are unable to provide additional feedback on individual applications.

BS in cognitive psychology from a top-tier university, 4 years of research experience post-bac with well-known people in the field, two conference presentations, second bachelors in CS at another top university.

"Rejected without no interview. Good GPA. Graduated from a UIUC-level US university . Multiple research experience, several leaderships including two software companies' founder. It is certainly not a good experience. Right after the deadline, I sent multiple emails to a POI but never get response. Whenever I send an email to the admission, my email got forwarded and replied with a generic email. I also applied the MSc program, and I heard multiple people saying that the school don't accept international student this year because they don't want to fund the higher tuition. It was very risky since I have only applied two schools. But luckily, I'm going to Oxford instead."
