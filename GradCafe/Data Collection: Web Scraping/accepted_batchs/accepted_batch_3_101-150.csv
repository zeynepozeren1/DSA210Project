"TTPB: Yes I heard the same things from my seniors. Tbh, whenever you ask a senior who has recently joined the university, he'll always have positives to talk about. People say they left gatech and columbia for usc. It's better to ask working professionals who graduated from USC and are working for like 1 year or so. You ask any working professional, 95% of them have the same opinion, that as long as the university is decent enough, nothing matters more than your calibre. My brother graduated from Rutgers and is currently working in California based company and his coworkers are from USC who are getting equally paid. He was able to waive off his debt in like 10 months, whereas his coworkers are still in debt."

"I contacted one of my seniors who went to USC in Spring 19 to know his view points. Posting it here so that many can benefit: 1) Major drawback is the internship opportunities. According to him, many students had really hard time finding internships. Now people say that you get 3 semesters to prepare for internships. So, then what about jobs? You waste 3 semesters in preparing and finding internships. Then there's only 1 semester to search for jobs and conversion of internships to jobs is really less. 2) Acc to him, wasting 6 months in India and then wasting 3-4 months in summer break is of no use. Yes, you can part time jobs in the break but is part time jobs > Your precious time in life and finding internships? 3) Many good professors at most universities including USC won't be available for Spring term as they are busy with research work. So for core courses, he had to take classes of some professors which weren't that great. 4) He graduated in December last year and is working at some Cali based startup that pays around 80-85k. Acc to him, his co-workers are from UT Dallas, UCSD, UIC, Penn state, NEU and NCSU. All these people are having the same pay. 5) His last view point was that career fairs at USC were total shit. They have some lottery based system to pick colors and you can only attend companies that fall under those colors. So, he advised me to go ahead with the other admit and not to obsess over USC."

"As a parent of a boy who has got admission into PennState, who wont be taking it since he has got Purdue and Wisc Mad PMP and will be most likely taking the former and will be considering OSU (another seat) along with PennState as trophies, I thought it right to comment about the situation this year as I have been following this site steadily for the past few months. My son has high end CGPA+rank from a top State college in India (forget this stupid Tier 1 etc that many Indian students rant about...I personally am an IIT B.Tech, IISc M.E. of yesteryears (1980s) and wont rant about it unnecessarily!) has 6 publications as on date (journal + conference...decent International ones...not the top most ones!) and I must say without doubt has been lucky to get what he got. I am aware of others with almost similar CGPA not getting any top 20 college, even some who are again seniors and rankers of my son from his college. I am also aware of some with lower CGPA and zero experience who have got top 20 from his college. While I admit, that I am illiterate in talking about SOP etc (as I never tried to go for higher studies in US in my times!), I can say that the idea that SOP defines the possibility sounds ridiculous. In fact one stupid comment I get from my son's contacts and even on net is that ""dont mention financial help in SOP"". To be precise my son mentioned it in almost all cases. There are comments about ""dont underline or use bold"" and I as the person who was helping review my son's SOP and even the LORs (which of course were accepted by his recommenders!) had BOLD, UNDERLINE and ITALICS. What I want to tell as a senior person about this GRAD program looking students are the following. 1. Getting a Univ in US (did not try other places) based on my son's and the others that I could track shows that IT IS JUST A LOTTERY. So many who are frustrated that what you perceive as you being better and not getting a college while somebody bad got it, just shows that you did not win the lottery. 2. While I said 1 above, certainly a CGPA of 9+ helps though I think 9.5+ seems to have a bit of negative effect especially in the top 30 colleges sometimes. They probably rejected you because they thought you were not going to join or you were not the right fit. 3. Coming to the above point, RIGHT FIT is what the Prof who took your Application thought about it. So if the right Prof got your appln. and he wanted you, may be you got it. In simple there is a high level of randomness and so dont curse yourself for failure. Bad luck. 4. Finally this year is THE REAL BAD YEAR. Penn State that my son got and will not be taking seems to have hardly taken more than few Indians. Strange but true. Many with decent profile didn't get it. I am not even talking of WiscMad rejecting hordes for the MS Traditional program. Overall, it looks like that Covid year is a big game where the Colleges were trying to find the right match and they had invariably hangover of previous year students who had deferred it. 5. The scene might only improve marginally next year as per my guess. Since the carry flow of the deferrals and the space lost last year (by folks not joining) will get into the next academic year, I dont think situation will be same even in 2021-2022 as it was in 2019-2020 and before. So the trouble you saw this academic year might actually continue for one more year if flow control exists. Anyway colleges have their ways of dealing with it. 6. Finally, I find there are 2 types of US colleges. Ones that you pay and get a seat easily potentially with say 9+ and nothing more (Columbia, UPenn, USC and even quite a few branches of CMU and well WiscMad PMP!) and others where you need to slug it out. If my career in the SWindustry of the past means anything, nobody in US in a job really cares so much about college etc (the Tier based approach so sadly seen in Indian colleges!) once they are placed in a job. So if you joined NCSU and I joined Cornell, it is not really that in the end you are low class and I am high class. Please try to understand that. Something I tend to educate my son as well. The truth is you are worth what you are and the colleges took you for what they felt you were. Good luck."

Torn between G.Tech MSCS and UCSD MSCS. Have got good and bad reviews on both. Slightly inclined towards UCSD because of more flexibility to choose courses and better CV research. People I reached out to said in rankings both colleges are identical. Agree to the general norms that both colleges have taken in good profiles as well as profiles below average in the name of diversity. Overall cost of the MS is also nearly identical at both places but UCSD seems to have the nicer weather while TA is completely waived off in GTech. Any responses would be highly appreciated

"After my 2 long comments yesterday with admits in OSU and then Purdue, got the third one for PMP at WiscMad. Not bad given that not even a handful got WiscMad MS CS (with aid option) and PMP is an excellent substitute for the same. Not sure how to choose between Purdue and PMP WM, though might end up on the former. UNC with hardly any seats gave the cold shoulder. Not bad for me with 11 applications to have 3 admits, 6 rejects and 2 waiting. One Penn likely to get, other UCSD GOK. The way UCSD which is the standard place even the low ranks from my college get, year after year, has neither rejected me nor accepted me, is rather funny. Was in the bottom of the LIFO stack having tried in Oct 20. Will wait but UCSD does not excite me any longer even a bit and Penn will add to the OSU like trophies which I wont carry. So very happy with Purdue and WM but not sure how to chose. All my admits have happened in past 9 days and I have waited since Oct 15 2020 for the same. WORTH THE WAIT. All the best to the others."

"Got my second admission and one that I can take. As I stated just below (in OSU admission) the same Lacey Siefers of Purdue who said I have not got admission writes stating ""I am excited to inform you that the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University is recommending you for admission to the MS program beginning fall 2021. You will receive your admission message from the Graduate School through the electronic application system in a few days. "" So for those who ask these schools whether they have been rejected, they simply state that you are not in accepted pool, so must be reject, but later like me can get the admit as the many applications including yours might be in processing. SO UNTIL YOU GET A REJECT ONE SHOULD WAIT. Also in my case, much against my dad's advice I chose to apply well in advance and so Purdue was my first application on Oct 15 followed by OSU in a few more days. I get Purdue almost a month after the first round. My third application in end Oct was UCSD and I am assuming I might again get it. EVERYTHING seems to be LIFO and not FIFO unless ofcourse like OSU all admits are sent out in a group. Along with the Purdue good news, I got a reject from GA. That means top 10 colleges (4 applied) all reject. Maybe my experience (just passed out in 2020 Aug) was not sufficient though I seem to have scalped something out by decent CGPA and a few Intl. Publications. Happy that I will hopefully fly out as Purdue is fine and I am more or less going to take it though I might wait for UCSD and for WiscMad PMP. Anyone has suggestions among these three can please respond. Two more awaited are UNC and PennState. All the best to other applicants."

I also forgot to mention that I was also accepted to the MCS program at UIUC, which is a professionally oriented program (the cost is on par with the UT Austin cost). I wanted to add that to the list of schools I am deciding between to see if anyone thinks that this is a better option than the 3 other schools mentioned. Also, TTPB, thanks so much for your input! If anyone else has inputs on any of these 4 schools, please let me know! I sincerely appreciate it :)"

"Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing well! I have been accepted to the CS MS programs at Columbia, UCLA, and UT Austin, and I'm having trouble finding any extremely concrete advantages/disadvantages that some of these schools have in relation to each other so that I can have tangible reasons for filtering some of the schools out and coming to a decision. I was wondering if anyone might have any insights, from personal experiences or from friends, about any of these schools that you would be willing to share. Columbia and UT Austin have coursework only options (without research), whereas at UCLA you're required to do a thesis/project, and since I am not planning on getting a PHD and I don't enjoy research very much, coursework only options appeal to me more. Cost is definitely one factor (Columbia comes out to be around $57,000 more expensive than UT Austin, and about $45,000 more than UCLA), but I don't want to base my decision solely, or extremely heavily on cost, as Columbia has some advantages the other schools do not (located in NYC, near Wall Street, as I am potentially interested in going into the fintech/financial industry after getting my Master's degree). Thanks so very much! :)"

We all can tell what kind of person you are by calling other students mediocre.
