"We received a high volume of applications this year and competition was very tough (this year's acceptance rate was approximately 11%). We regret to advise you that we are unable to offer you admission. You will receive official notification by the regular postal service. The admission decision is based on the overall evaluation of the application. This includes your statement of purpose, transcripts, CV and letters of reference, as well as an assessment of your qualifications according to the standards set by the Department of Computer Science and the School of Graduate Studies and an assessment of the potential for success in the graduate program. The Admission Committee's decision is not based on any single factor but rather on the overall evaluation of the application. The process is extremely selective as we receive many more highly-qualified applications than we can accept. Deliberations of the Graduate Admissions Committee are confidential and we are unable to accept or consider appeals of rejection."

I regret to inform you that your application for admission to the Computing Science MSc program in the School of Computing Science was unsuccessful. We received many excellent applications this year and the admissions committee that reviewed your application was unable to recommend admission. We receive far more applications for admission than we can possibly admit due to resource limitations and therefore some deserving applicants cannot be admitted. Regrettably we are not able to respond to inquiries about this decision. I would like to thank you for your interest in attending Simon Fraser University and want to wish you success in your future endeavors.
