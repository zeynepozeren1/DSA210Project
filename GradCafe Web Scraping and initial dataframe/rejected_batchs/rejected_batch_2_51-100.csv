"MLT I regret to inform you that we are unable to admit you into the M.S. in Language Technologies program in the Language Technologies Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. We received over 750 graduate applications this year in Language Technologies, a large percentage of which are highly qualified. However, our graduate program can support only a limited number of new students. This makes our decision very difficult, as we have to turn down many promising applicants. Unfortunately, we could not admit all applicants despite very good academic records and supporting letters. We hope you have been accepted by another graduate program of your choice, and wish you the best in your career."

I've received a couple acceptances, so something about the tone of the email was different and I could see the rejection coming before I saw it officially on the portal. The email also came at 11:08pm (PT), I feel like people don't send out good news at that time. Disappointed, was a dream school. Still waiting to hear from UC Berkeley."

As indicated in my previous emails, your application was very strong and we reached this decision due to our program being capped at just 35 students out of an applicant pool of over 1200. Our yield this year was higher than usual and so we were unfortunately not able to admit anyone from our waitlist. Thank you again for your patience, understanding, and assistance during the long admissions process, and once again, we are sorry you were not included in the admitted students.

A bunch of other stuff as well, but if I mention them it will be very easy to identify me. Good SOP, extremely strong LORs written by an impressive group that included Stanford professors. There are people out there saying that if you get a graduate certificate at Stanford you are basically guaranteed admission. This is NOT the case; I know of 3-4 people in similar shape to me that got rejected this cycle."

Rejected from MS CS program at UC Berkeley. 2+ years of undergraduate research experience at a large state school and 3 good LORs. Likely was rejected due to lack of publications and not being a great research fit. Expected this. Congratulations to everyone who gets in!

A piece of advice: Do NOT apply to Berkeley's MSCS unless you are dead certain that your portfolio stands out one in thousands. MS/PhD program usually has a much higher acceptance rate than MS only.

Rough cumulative GPA due to a couple of terms where I really struggled with completing schoolwork, due to external sources. Not very surprised at the result. Honestly, if anybody has any advice for how I can turn my chances next time I apply, despite not being able to change my GPA, I'd love to hear it in the comments."

Rejected from the MS CS program. I have an undergraduate degree in CS from a large state school. I have 2 years of undergraduate research experience. Decent SOP and 3 good LORs from faculty members I worked with. Likely was rejected due to having only one publication as well as not being a great fit with potential advisors. Congratulations to everyone who got in!

I have 2 years of undergraduate research experience and 3 good LORs from professors I have worked with, however, no publications in Computer Science. Additionally, the research fit wasn't that good either. Thus, this was expected. Congratulations to those that do get in."

"I was a Fall 2020 waitlisted candidate, who re-activated the application for the Fall 2021 term. The rejection was pretty much expected due to the long wait and I'm sure Columbia must have directly rejected the Fall 2020 waitlisted applications, without even reviewing them or having a look at those profiles. This really shows the unprofessional and careless attitude of a prestigious Ivy League University like Columbia."

Also, they aren't offering direct deferrals to international students. So, I think the spring admits are reserved for the students in the US. All the best you'll"

"First off, this year they had to review nearly 2000 applicants and therefore, from my perspective, it's nearly impossible for them to review each and every candidate (Due to showing 'submitted' on majority of candidate's status). Secondly, the students who got in have been in touch with one/two Profs and after an interview, they may / may be not get into the program. So from my standpoint, this year is going to be a mass rejection in this department!! Because, a lot of students from last year have ""DEFERRED"" their 2020 admission to 2021!!!"
