I am a working professional so I actually applied to the professional Master's program (part-time) and not the full-time program on campus. Does anybody have any input or say on this program? Is it reputable and worth all the money? It appears to be much easier to get accepted than the full-time program and it's taught my tech leaders and not necessarily research professors. The application process was free and does not even require GRE! Let me know what you guys think, thanks!"

I told them that I just went and took it as I knew a standardized test could not show my performance in graduate school. They stated that is what they thought and then accepted me on the spot with an assistantship. - Just shows that the GRE is not the end of all things.

Cornell Undergrad with Business major (Dyson) and CS minor. For future applicants with questions about the interview: - lasted 30 min. over Skype with a professor in the specific field that I mentioned being interested in. - some technical questions but not very difficult if you have a good base + if you're lacking in some area you should just admit you don't know and they'll assign you to an online summer class before starting. Honesty is the best policy ;) - mostly questions about why Cornell Tech and why CS. The program is pretty different from other Masters programs so you should have a good reason why you are attracted to this specific structure and set of classes. - was told that I should receive an offer at the end of the interview and received the official acceptance letter exactly 2 weeks later
