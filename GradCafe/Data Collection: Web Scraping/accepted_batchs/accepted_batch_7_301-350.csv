"Graduated from top Canadian university with above-average GPA and several years of industrial experience. Had taken one NDO course at Stanford before (got A-) and got V730/Q800 before applying in 2010. Thought that was good enough but was rejected on the first try. Took two more Stanford NDO courses (got A+ on both) and took 2 months off work to volunteer on an academic research project last year and re-applied. Finally got in. To those of you who aren't so fortunate this year but are determined to re-try - despair not, take more courses and perseverance will deliver!"

By the way, for anyone in the future who is worried about a low GRE Verbal score affecting chances of admissions -- DON'T! I thought a 460 Verbal would ruin my chances at top programs, but apparently all of the programs were able to overlook it. Best of luck to you!"
